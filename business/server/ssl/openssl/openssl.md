## Welcome to OpenSSL!

The OpenSSL Project develops and maintains the OpenSSL software - a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication. The project's technical decision making is managed by the [OpenSSL Technical Committee](https://www.openssl.org/community/otc.html) (OTC) and the project governance is managed by the [OpenSSL Management Committee](https://www.openssl.org/community/omc.html) (OMC). The project operates under formal [Bylaws](https://www.openssl.org/policies/omc-bylaws.html).

For more information about the team and community around the project, or to start making your own contributions, start with the [community](https://www.openssl.org/community) page.
