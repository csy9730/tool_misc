The Keil RTX is a royalty-free, deterministic Real-Time Operating System designed for ARM and Cortex-M devices. It allows you to create programs that simultaneously perform multiple functions and helps to create applications which are better structured and more easily maintained.

[ Features](https://www.keil.com/arm/rl-arm/rtx_specs.asp)

### Features

- Royalty-free, deterministic RTOS with source code
- Flexible Scheduling: round-robin, pre-emptive, and collaborative
- [High-Speed](https://www.keil.com/arm/rl-arm/rtx_perf.asp) real-time operation with low interrupt latency
- [Small](https://www.keil.com/arm/rl-arm/rtx_size.asp) footprint for resource constrained systems
- Unlimited number of tasks each with 254 priority levels
- Unlimited number of mailboxes, semaphores, mutex, and timers
- Support for multithreading and [thread-safe](https://www.keil.com/arm/rl-arm/rl_threadsafe.asp) operation
- Kernel aware [debug](https://www.keil.com/rl-arm/rtx_debug.asp) support in [MDK-ARM](https://www.keil.com/arm/mdk.asp)
- Dialog-based setup using ÂµVision [Configuration Wizard](https://www.keil.com/rl-arm/rl_config.asp)

### Benefits

While it is certainly possible to create real-time programs without an RTOS (by executing one or more functions in a Super-loop), there are numerous scheduling, maintenance, and timing issues that an RTOS like the Keil RTX solves for you. For a more detailed comparison between RTOS and Super-loop, take a look at the [advantages of using an RTOS](https://www.keil.com/rl-arm/rtx_rtosadv.asp).
