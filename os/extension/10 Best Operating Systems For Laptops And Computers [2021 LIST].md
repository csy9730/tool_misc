## What Is The Difference Between Server OS And Everyday OS?

Understanding how to differentiate a server OS from an everyday one is vital to our discussion. The differences are very specific.

An everyday OS will be able to run programs like MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. including running one of your favorite video games. It enables applications that make browsing the web and checking emails easy. It uses LAN and Bluetooth connections and is cheaper than a server OS.

Server OS, on the other hand, are expensive and rightfully so. These platforms enable unlimited user connections, a greater memory capacity, and act as universal servers for web, emails, and databases.

A server OS can handle multiple desktops as it is optimized for a network instead of catering to a single user.

## What Is An Operating System?

An operating system in its most general definition is the software that allows a user to run crucial applications on his/her computing device. It helps to manage a computer’s hardware resources. It helps to support basic functions like scheduling tasks, and controlling peripherals.

**Which OS Is Best For Personal Use?**

When it comes to home use, traditional Windows and MAC OS are great options. At home, you don’t need powerful OS especially for simple tasks like writing or browsing the web. For gaming, the Windows operating system is well optimized than that of MAC.

**Which Is The Fastest OS?**

While discussing the fastest OS, there is no argument that Linux based OS is the lightest and fastest OS in the market right now. It doesn’t need a powerful processor unlike Windows to operate at an optimal level.

Linux based OS like Ubuntu Server, CentOS server, Fedora is great options especially for running business enterprises where substantial computing power is mandatory.

### Free Operating System Alternatives

We understand that not everyone has enough dollars to afford a high-grade operating system for their computers. However, that’s not all the bad news as there are free OS alternatives which ensure that your computer keeps running. All the below options are available for download, hence you can simply install it today.

- **Linux:** Linux is absolutely free and will literally run on anything.
- **Chrome OS:** Chrome OS is available on a number of Low cost and some high-end laptops, like chrome books.
- **Free BSD:** With its roots connected to Linux, it is the modern-day version of the Berkeley Software Distribution.
- **Syllable:** Syllable is yet another free alternative for home and small business users only.
- **ReactOS:** Initially launched as a Windows 95 clone, this OS has come a long way since then.

**Notable mentions go to OS like Haiku, MorphOS, Android.**

### OS Market Share

Android: 39.19%, Windows: 35.12, iOS: 13.85%, MAC OS: 5 %, Linux: 0.77% are some numbers for the market share of these companies.

As of July 2019, Android’s pervasiveness through portable smartphones has made it an undisputed leader in the Operating Systems domain.

It is followed closely by Windows whose familiarity crosses boundaries beyond the United States. Apple iOS and Mac OS are understandably behind because of their exclusiveness to the Apple brand.

**Pro Tip:** Before deciding on your operating system, try to identify what your requirements are. If you have a budget and want the best gaming and application experience then maybe you won’t mind spending a few bucks on the Windows Pro Version. For entrepreneurs, who might be looking for more than just an application running system, opt for a Linux based system for optimal results.

The below list aims at making your decision-making process simpler, hence you don’t need to waste time on pondering over what is best.
