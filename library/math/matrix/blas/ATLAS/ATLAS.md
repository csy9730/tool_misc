The ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) project is an ongoing research effort focusing on applying empirical techniques in order to provide portable performance. At present, it provides C and Fortran77 interfaces to a portably efficient **BLAS** implementation, as well as a few routines from **LAPACK**.

If you download the software, it is critically important that you check the [ATLAS errata file](http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html). This file lists all known errors in ATLAS, and all known system problems (eg., compiler errors, etc), and any fixes and workarounds.

See [the faq](http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/faq.html#help) for support help.

The newest ATLAS papers can be found [here](http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~whaley/papers.html).
