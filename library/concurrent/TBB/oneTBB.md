Intel® oneAPI Threading Building Blocks
Scalable Parallel Programming at Your Fingertips


Simplified Development for Parallel Applications
Intel® oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB)† is a flexible performance library that simplifies the work of adding parallelism to complex applications across accelerated architectures, even if you’re not a threading expert.

oneTBB is ideal for a wide range of compute-intense domains, such as:

- Numeric weather prediction
- Oceanography
- Astrophysics
- Genetic engineering
- Seismic exploration
- AI and automation
- Energy resource exploration
- Socioeconomics

†Intel® Threading Building Blocks (Intel® TBB) is now called Intel oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) to highlight that the tool is part of the oneAPI ecosystem.
