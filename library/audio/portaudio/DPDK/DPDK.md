### DPDK is the Data Plane Development Kit that consists of libraries to accelerate packet processing workloads running on a wide variety of CPU architectures.

Designed to run on x86, POWER and ARM processors, it runs mostly in Linux userland, with a FreeBSD port available for a subset of DPDK features. DPDK is licensed under the Open Source BSD License. The most recent patches and enhancements are [available for download](https://git.dpdk.org/dpdk/log/).



### DPDK Library Features





#### Receive and Send Packets Within the Minimum Number of CPU Cycles



#### Develop Fast Packet Capture Algorithms (tcpdump-like)



#### Run Third-Party Fast Path Stacks

*Some packet processing functions have been benchmarked up to hundreds million frames per second, using 64-byte packets with a PCIe NIC.*
