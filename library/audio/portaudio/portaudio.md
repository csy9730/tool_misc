[![PortAudio Portable Cross-platform Audio I/O API](http://portaudio.com/images/portaudio_logotext.png)](http://portaudio.com/)



PortAudio is a free, cross-platform, [open-source](http://portaudio.com/license.html), audio I/O library.  It lets you write simple audio programs in 'C' or C++ that will compile and run on many platforms including Windows, Macintosh OS X, and Unix (OSS/ALSA). It is intended to promote the exchange of audio software between developers on different platforms. Many [applications](http://portaudio.com/apps.html) use PortAudio for Audio I/O.

PortAudio provides a very simple API for recording and/or playing sound using a simple callback function or a blocking read/write interface. Example programs are included that play sine waves, process audio input (guitar fuzz), record and playback audio, list available audio devices, etc.

The Portaudio [Wiki](https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio/wiki) is maintained by the community of PortAudio developers. It has the most up-to-date information and is recommended as a starting point for exploring PortAudio. PortAudio developers and users keep in touch on the [PortAudio mailing list](http://portaudio.com/contacts.html). Please feel free to join.

The PortAudio project and API was proposed by [Ross Bencina](http://www.audiomulch.com/~rossb/) to the [music-dsp](http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/music-dsp/) mailing list. Ross uses PortAudio in his [AudioMulch](http://www.audiomulch.com/) synthesis application. Many people have since [contributed](http://portaudio.com/people.html) to PortAudio's development.

This website is hosted and maintained by Phil Burk of [SoftSynth.com](http://www.softsynth.com/). Phil is also a co-designer of PortAudio and used it for audio I/O in [JSyn,](http://www.softsynth.com/jsyn/) a real-time synthesis API for Java and 'C'.
