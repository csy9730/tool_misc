[Arm Run-Time System for Functional Safety](https://www.keil.com/fusa-rts)

[Arm FuSa RTS](https://www.keil.com/fusa-rts) is a set of safety-certified software components for Cortex-M devices that includes RTX RTOS, C Library, CMSIS-Core and Event Recorder. It natively integrates with [Keil MDK](https://www.keil.com/mdk5) and is certified for use with the [safety qualified Arm C/C++ Compiler](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/arm-compiler/safety). This approach simplifies system design and validation and frees up time for the development and certification of the end application.

[ULINK Debug Adapters](https://www.keil.com/ulink/)

ULINK debug adapters allow you to program, debug, and analyze your embedded applications. [ULINK*pro*](https://www.keil.com/mdk5/ulink/ulinkpro) adapter provides high performance streaming of instruction trace. [ULINK*plus*](https://www.keil.com/mdk5/ulink/ulinkplus) enables power measurement and test automation. [ULINK2](https://www.keil.com/mdk5/ulink/ulink2) is the best choice for basic debugging of Arm and legacy architectures.

[8051 Development Tools](https://www.keil.com/c51/)

[Keil C51](https://www.keil.com/c51) is the industry-standard toolchain for all [8051-compatible devices](https://www.keil.com/dd), it supports classic 8051, Dallas 390, NXP MX, extended 8051 variants, and C251 devices. The [µVision IDE](https://www.keil.com/uvision) and [debugger](https://www.keil.com/debug) integrates complete device simulation, interfaces to many target debug adapters, and provides various monitor debug solutions.

[C166 Development Tools](https://www.keil.com/c166/)

[Keil C166](https://www.keil.com/c166) development tools support the [Infineon C166, XC166, XE166, XC2000 and ST10](https://www.keil.com/dd) microcontroller families. The [µVision IDE](https://www.keil.com/uvision) and [debugger](https://www.keil.com/debug) interfaces to the Infineon [DAVE](https://www.keil.com/appnotes/docs/apnt_148.asp) code generation tool and various debug solutions including the [ULINK2](https://www.keil.com/ulink).
