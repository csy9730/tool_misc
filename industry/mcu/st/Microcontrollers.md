By choosing one of ST's microcontrollers & microprocessors for your embedded application, you gain from our leading expertise in scalable computing architecture, silicon technology, wireless state-of-the-art IPs and software stacks, embedded real-time and application software, multi-source manufacturing and worldwide support.

ST's wide-ranging microcontroller product portfolio spans from robust, low-cost [8-bit MCUs](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm8-8-bit-mcus.html) up to [32-bit Arm®-based Cortex®-M microcontrollers](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html) with a comprehensive choice of peripherals. Its breadth ensures that design engineers will find the mix of performance, power efficiency and security that is required by their application.

The [STM32 Microcontroller (MCU)](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html) portfolio also features wireless connectivity solutions including our ultra-low-power System-on-Chips: [single- and dual-core STM32WL](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus/stm32-wireless-mcus/stm32wl-series.html) and [dual-core STM32WB](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus/stm32-wireless-mcus/stm32wb-series.html). 

- The STM32WL wireless SoC is a multi-protocol and open wireless MCU platform able to run the [LoRaWAN](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/wireless-transceivers-mcus-and-modules/lorawan-technology.html)® protocol through LoRa® modulation, as well as other ad-hoc protocols based on LoRa®, (G)FSK, (G)MSK or BPSK modulations.
- The multi-protocol wireless STM32WB MCU platform can run [Bluetooth® 5.2](https://launchstudio.bluetooth.com/ListingDetails/120676), [OpenThread](https://openthread.io/certification), [Zigbee 3.0](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/applications/connectivity/wireless-connectivity/zigbee.html) and proprietary protocols, in standalone or concurrently.

With the addition of the [STM32 Microprocessor (MPU)](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-arm-cortex-mpus.html) and its heterogeneous architecture combining Arm® Cortex®-A and Cortex®-M Cores, embedded system engineers are given new design possibilities and access to open-source Linux and Android platforms. This **flexible architecture** allows the advanced digital and analog peripherals to be allocated to either core, while achieving the **best power efficiency** depending on processing and real-time execution requirements. To help engineers **reduce application development time**, a fully mainlined open-source Linux distribution and a new-generation system toolset from ST and 3rd parties are now available for STM32 MCUs and MPUs.
