git lfs <command> [<args>]

Git LFS is a system for managing and versioning large files in
association with a Git repository.  Instead of storing the large files
within the Git repository as blobs, Git LFS stores special "pointer
files" in the repository, while storing the actual file contents on a
Git LFS server.  The contents of the large file are downloaded
automatically when needed, for example when a Git branch containing
the large file is checked out.

Git LFS works by using a "smudge" filter to look up the large file
contents based on the pointer file, and a "clean" filter to create a
new version of the pointer file when the large file's contents change.
It also uses a pre-push hook to upload the large file contents to
the Git LFS server whenever a commit containing a new large file
version is about to be pushed to the corresponding Git server.

Commands
--------

Like Git, Git LFS commands are separated into high level ("porcelain")
commands and low level ("plumbing") commands.

* git lfs fsck:
    Check Git LFS files for consistency.
* git lfs install:
    Install Git LFS configuration.
* git lfs lock:
    Set a file as "locked" on the Git LFS server.
* git lfs locks:
    List currently "locked" files from the Git LFS server.
* git lfs logs:
    Show errors from the Git LFS command.
* git lfs ls-files:

* git lfs migrate:
    Migrate history to or from Git LFS
* git lfs prune:
    Delete old Git LFS files from local storage
* git lfs pull:
    Fetch Git LFS changes from the remote & checkout any required working tree
    files.
* git lfs push:
    Push queued large files to the Git LFS endpoint.
* git lfs status:
    Show the status of Git LFS files in the working tree.
* git lfs track:
    View or add Git LFS paths to Git attributes.
* git lfs uninstall:
    Uninstall Git LFS by removing hooks and smudge/clean filter configuration.
* git lfs unlock:
    Remove "locked" setting for a file on the Git LFS server.
* git lfs untrack:
    Remove Git LFS paths from Git Attributes.
* git lfs update:
    Update Git hooks for the current Git repository.
* git lfs version:
    Report the version number.

Low level commands
-------------------

* git lfs clean:
    Git clean filter that converts large files to pointers.
* git lfs pointer:
    Build and compare pointers.
* git lfs pre-push:
    Git pre-push hook implementation.
* git lfs filter-process:
    Git process filter that converts between large files and pointers.
* git lfs smudge:
    Git smudge filter that converts pointer in blobs to the actual content.

Examples
--------

To get started with Git LFS, the following commands can be used.

 1. Setup Git LFS on your system. You only have to do this once per
    repository per machine:

        git lfs install

 2. Choose the type of files you want to track, for examples all ISO
    images, with git lfs track:

        git lfs track "*.iso"

 3. The above stores this information in gitattributes(5) files, so
    that file need to be added to the repository:

        git add .gitattributes

 3. Commit, push and work with the files normally:

        git add file.iso
        git commit -m "Add disk image"
        git push
```
