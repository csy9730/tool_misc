Chartify is a Python library that makes it easy for data scientists to create charts.

Why use Chartify?

- Consistent input data format: Spend less time transforming data to get your charts to work. All plotting functions use a consistent tidy input data format.
- Smart default styles: Create pretty charts with very little customization required.
- Simple API: We've attempted to make the API as intuitive and easy to learn as possible.
- Flexibility: Chartify is built on top of Bokeh, so if you do need more control you can always fall back on Bokeh's API.
