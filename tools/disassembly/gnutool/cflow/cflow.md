#### [Introduction to cflow](https://www.gnu.org/software/cflow/#TOCintroduction)

GNU cflow analyzes a collection of C source files and prints a graph, charting control flow within the program.

GNU cflow is able to produce both direct and inverted flowgraphs for C sources. Optionally a cross-reference listing can be generated. Two output formats are implemented: POSIX and GNU (extended).

Input files can optionally be preprocessed before analyzing.

The package also provides Emacs major mode for examining the produced flowcharts in Emacs.

A [sample](https://www.gnu.org/software/cflow/sample.html) of a direct flowchart is available online.
