# Local vs. Client-Server Mode

SEER*Stat can operate in one of two modes, "local" and "client-server". In local mode, all processing and data are **local** to your PC environment; that is, your PC performs all calculations, and the program and data files are stored on the PC itself, your local network, or a CD. In client-server mode, the SEER*Stat software installed on your PC is the **client** and contacts the SEER **server** via the Internet to access data and perform calculations.

| In Local Mode:                                               | In Client-Server Mode:                                       |

| It is not necessary to be connected to the Internet.         | Your PC must be connected to the Internet, your firewall (if any) must allow communication with the SEER server, and you must have access to e-mail. |
| Calculations are performed by your PC. You must have a local copy of the SEER databases (on CD, hard drive, or network drive). | Calculations are performed by servers maintained by the SEER Program, using the data stored there. |
| You have access to the databases on your CD, PC, or local network. | You have access to a wider range of databases than are available on the CD-ROM. |
| You must check for and download new versions of SEER*Stat and the SEER databases. (You will receive e-mail notifying you of new versions that feature major changes.) | You automatically receive new releases of the SEER*Stat program, and new databases will be available for use as soon as they are released.* |
| Your computer may be slowed down during large or complex analyses, and must remain on. | Your computer will operate at normal speed while the SEER hardware performs analyses, and may be turned off entirely if you use the **Finish Offline** feature. (You will be notified by e-mail when analyses are complete.) |

SEER*Stat determines which mode to operate in according to the database you select on each session's [Data tab](https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/WebHelp/Data_Tab.htm). If the selected database is stored in a server [data location](https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/WebHelp/Data_Locations.htm), SEER*Stat operates in client-server mode; if it is stored in a local data location, SEER*Stat operates in local mode.

When you connect to the server in client-server mode, you will be prompted for your [user name and password](https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/WebHelp/Logging_In_and_Your_User_Information.htm).
