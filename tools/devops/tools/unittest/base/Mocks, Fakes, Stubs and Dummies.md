# Mocks, Fakes, Stubs and Dummies

Are you confused about what someone means when they say "test stub" or "mock object"? Do you sometimes feel that the person you are talking to is using a very different definition? Well, you are not alone!

The terminology around the various kinds of [Test Doubles](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test Double.html) *(page X)* is confusing and inconsistent. Different authors use different terms to mean the same thing. And sometimes they mean different things by the same term! Ouch! (See the sidebar [What's in a (Pattern) Name?](http://xunitpatterns.com/Whats in a Name.html) *(page X)* for why I think names are important.)

Part of the reason for writing this book was to try to establish some consistency in the terminology to give people a set of names with clear definitions of what they mean. In this sidebar, I provide a list of the current sources and cross-reference the terminology they use with what I use in this book.





## Role Descriptions

Here is a summary of what I mean by each of the major [Test Double](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test Double.html) pattern names:

| Pattern                                                      | Purpose                                      | Has Behavior | Injects [indirect inputs](http://xunitpatterns.com/indirect input.html) into SUT | Handles [indirect outputs](http://xunitpatterns.com/indirect output.html) of SUT | Values provided by test(er) | Examples                             |

## Terminology Cross-Reference

I'm listing some sources of conflicting definitions just to make it clear what the mapping is to my pattern names:

|                                                              | Sources and Names Used in them |      |          |        |       |       |      |                    |         |

| [Test Double](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test Double.html)     |                                |      |          |        |       |       |      | Double or stand-in |         |
| [Dummy Object](http://xunitpatterns.com/Dummy Object.html)   | Stub                           |      |          |        | Dummy |       |      |                    | Stub    |
| [Test Stub](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test Stub.html)         | Fake                           |      | Fake     | Stub   | Stub  | Dummy |      | Mock               | Fake    |
| [Test Spy](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test Spy.html)           |                                |      |          |        |       | Dummy |      |                    | Spy     |
| [Mock Object](http://xunitpatterns.com/Mock Object.html)     | Mock                           |      | Mock     | Mock   | Mock  | Mock  |      | Mock               | Mock    |
| [Fake Object](http://xunitpatterns.com/Fake Object.html)     |                                |      |          |        |       | Dummy |      |                    |         |
| [Temporary Test Stub](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test Stub.html#Temporary Test Stub) |                                |      |          |        |       | Stub  |      |                    |         |
| OMG's CORBA Stub                                             |                                |      |          |        |       |       | Stub |                    |         |

Some specific examples from this table are:

- Unit Testing With Java ([[UTwJ\]](http://xunitpatterns.com/UTMJ.html)) uses the term "Dummy Object" to refer to what I am calling a "Fake Object".
- Pragmatic Unit Testing [[PUT\]](http://xunitpatterns.com/PUT.html) describes a "Stub" as an empty implementation of a method. This is a common interpretation in the procedural world but in the object world this is typically called a [Null Object](http://xunitpatterns.com/Null Object.html)[PLOPD3].
- Some of the early Mock Objects literature could be interpreted to equate a Stub with a Mock Object. This has since been clarified in [[MRNO\]](http://xunitpatterns.com/Mock Roles.html) and [[MAS\]](http://xunitpatterns.com/MAS.html).
- The CORBA standard (CORBA stands for Common Object Request Broker Architecture and is defined by the Object Management Group)and other remote-procedure call specifications use the terms "stubs" and "skeletons" to refer to the automatically generated code for the near and far end implementation of a remote interface defined in IDL. (I've only included this here because it is another use of one of the terms we commonly use in the TDD and automated developer testing community.)
