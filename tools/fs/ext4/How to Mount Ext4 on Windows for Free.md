Yes, by default, Ext4 files are not supported on Windows operating  system, making you clueless on how to proceed further.

## Part 2: Solutions – How to mount Ext4 on Windows

In this part, we will share some solutions through which you can **mount Ext4 on Windows.** Let us read each of them one by one.

1.  **Use of Windows File System Diver applications**

One way to **mount Ext4 on Windows** is to use the Windows File System Driver apps like Ext2Fsd, and Ext2explore.

You can get the app from here: http://www.ext2fsd.com/. 

- [Ext2explore](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2read/)**:** With no installation required, this open-source application, Ext2explore,  only requires you to run the .exe file. Think twice before you go for  this tool, as there is no file preview feature available.

To download Ext2explore on your Windows, try the link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2read/
