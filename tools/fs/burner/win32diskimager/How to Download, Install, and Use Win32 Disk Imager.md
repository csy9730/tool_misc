# How to Download, Install, and Use Win32 Disk Imager

## Win32 Disk Imager

To describe Win32 Disk Imager, we must first understand what disk images are. Disk images can be traced back all the way to the 60s. After they first came out, disk images were used to replicate optical media and back up information. Such technology eventually made DVDs and CDs obsolete. Nowadays, rather than inserting physical CDs into a reader and accessing information, disk images can be opened up to access specific files. Let’s go over what is necessary to install what is known as “Win32 Disk Imager.”
