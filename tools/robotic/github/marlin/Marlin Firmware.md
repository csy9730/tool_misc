## Stepper Motor Repurposer

First created in 2011 for RepRap and Ultimaker by [Erik van der Zalm](https://github.com/ErikZalm) et. al., today Marlin drives most of the world's 3D printers. Reliable and precise, Marlin delivers outstanding print quality while keeping you in full control of the process.

As an [Open Source](https://opensource.org/) project hosted on [Github](https://github.com/), Marlin is owned and maintained by the maker community. [Learn how you can contribute!](https://marlinfw.org/docs/development/contributing.html)
