## overview
OpenPLC is an open-source Programmable Logic Controller that is based on easy to use software. Our focus is to provide a low cost industrial solution for automation and research. OpenPLC has been used in many research papers as a framework for industrial cyber security research, given that it is the only controller to provide the entire source code. The OpenPLC Project consists of three sub-projects:
