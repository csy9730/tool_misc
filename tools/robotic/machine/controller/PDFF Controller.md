Traditionally in servo systems, the PI(D) controller has been widely used, while other types such as the PDF controller has been applied in some applications. In this article, the PDFF controller which has feedforward term in addition to a conventional PDF(Pseudo-Derivative Feedback) controller is introduced. Tracking and regulation characteristics of the PDFF controller in motion control applications are analyzed in terms of classical frequency domain approach. The PDFF controller is shown to be a generalized PI(D) controller, and relative performance of the well-known cascade PI(D) controller and the PDF controller are dealt with as two special cases. A tuning method of this controller to meet desired performance criteria such as dynamic reference tracking, steady-state error and load torque disturbance rejection capability is discussed along with experimental results.

## [Earthquake Ground Motion Matching on a Small Electric Shaking Table Using a Combined NN-PDFF Controller](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sv/2020/7260590/)

#### Abstract

> Replicating acceleration time histories with high accuracy on shaking table platforms is still a challenging task. The complex interference between the components of the system, the inherent nonlinearities, and the coupling effect between the specimen and the shaking table are among other reasons that most affect the control performance. In this paper, a neural network- (NN-) based controller has been developed and experimentally implemented to improve the acceleration tracking performance of an electric shaking table. The latter is a biaxial shaking table driven by linear motors and controlled by a proportional-derivative-feedforward (PDFF) controller that is very efficient in reproducing displacement waveforms on the detriment of the simulation of the prescribed acceleration ground motions. In order to bypass this shortcoming, a control scheme combining the PDFF as a basic control function with a NN controller which filters the shaking table feedback signal and acts on the drive signal by compensating for acceleration distortions is proposed in this study. Several experimental tests have been carried out to build a database for offline training, validating, and testing of the proposed NN control model. Subsequently, the well-trained NN is implemented in the inner control loop of the shaking table to compensate, in parallel with the PDFF controller, the distortions during the replication of acceleration signals. Results of tests using earthquake records showed an enhancement in signal matching when integrating the NN model for both bare and loaded conditions of the shaking table. The tracking errors, estimated using the relative root-mean-square error, between the measured and the desired signal, are significantly reduced in time and frequency domains with the additional NN online controller.
