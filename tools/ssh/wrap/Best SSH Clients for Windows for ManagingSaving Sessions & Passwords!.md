Believe it or not, Secure Shell (SSH) is becoming one of the most important remote connection protocols today.

**Here is our list of the six best SSH clients for Windows:**

1. **Solar-PuTTY – FREE TOOL** This free tool, provided by SolarWinds, that builds on the functionality of the original PuTTY.  This system offers a better interface that integrates file transfers  with SFTP as well as SCP. The interface connects to remote computers  with SSH and Telnet.
2. **PuTTY** This very old terminal emulator is an  inspiration for all subsequent remote access systems. This tool offers  Telnet, SSH, Rlogin, and raw socket connections plus SFTP and SCP for  file transfers.
3. **SecureCRT** This remote access system is available  for macOS, Linux, and iOS as well as Windows. It offers terminal  emulation and file transfer through an SSH tunnel.
4. **SmarTTY** A free SSH client that has a multi-tabbed  interface to allow multiple simultaneous connections. This tool also  includes SCP capabilities for file transfers.
5. **mRemoteNG** This popular, free remote desktop system  includes a tabbed interface for multiple simultaneous connections. The  system offers access with RDP, Telnet, Rlogin, VNC, and SSH.
6. **MobaXterm** This easy-to-use remote access system is  available in free and paid versions and is built for Unix and Linux, and well as Windows. The tool SSH and SFTP.

SSH is used by many systems and network administrators to connect to their remote cloud computing resources.

It can help them create an SSH tunnel and solve problems while avoiding putting the resources at risk.

The SSH client is the key element to providing this secure and flexible SSH tunnel connection to any remote resource.

It provides access through the command line of the remote resource and lets you execute any command to monitor or fix issues.





There are many SSH clients available for free, but most of them do not fulfill the standards for serious everyday users. 

We'll go over the Top SSH clients for Windows in the following list  and show all the different options and flexibility they have.

It all depends on what you need, but going with one or the other will certainly give you a good head start.

## What should you look for in secure SSH clients?

We reviewed the market for SSH clients for Windows that enable  session and password saving and analyzed the tools based on the  following criteria:

- A secure remote terminal utility
- An encrypted password storage system
- A system for storing connection settings to enable point-and-click immediate contact
- The ability to maintain multiple sessions open
- Session pause and resume functions
- A free trial or a free tool
- A free tool that is worth using or a paid tool that offers value for money

With these selection criteria in mind, we located a range of options for secure SSH clients that are written for Windows.

## Here are the Best SSH Clients for Windows of 2021:

### 1. SolarPuTTY





[SolarPuTTY](https://www.solarwinds.com/free-tools/solar-putty) is a 100% free SSH client for Windows, developed by SolarWinds.

Although SolarPuTTY carries the name PuTTY, it does a lot more than just open SSH sessions to remote devices.

It also supports SCP, SFTP, and Telnet and comes with additional features.

**Key Features:**

- Save credentials and private keys for auto-login.
- Open multiple sessions through tabs.
- Access to frequently used sessions.
- Reconnect automatically.
- SFTP file transfer Graphical User Interface.
- Support of automation of post-connections scripts.

SolarPuTTY integrated a modern interface that is easy to use.

This interface lets you work on simultaneous sessions through its  multi-tabbed single console, and allows you quick access to previous  sessions.

But one of the best and most popular features is its tabbed interface.

With PuTTY, you had to open the interface multiple times, and swap  between applications which made it difficult to navigate through.

But the SolarPuTTY can establish multiple sessions within the same console and lets you switch back and forth between them.

The homepage includes quick access “Single-click” logging of each session with saved credentials and private keys.

| Pros: Completely free to use Integrates with SCP and SFTP giving it more functionality than PuTTY Offers secure credential storage for fast and frequent access Can color-code multiple sessions to help organize simultaneous connections Can automatically reconnect if the connection is interrupted | Cons:  Like PuTTY, this tool is designed for technical professionals and requires basic networking knowledge before use |

### Final Words & Conclusion

If you are looking for a good SSH client for Windows, you don’t have to search anymore.

Any of the tools shown in this list can provide you with secured SSH tunnels at a decent price, and in most cases, for free.

One of the preferred features, found in the new SSH clients, of many  system admins is the ability to use multiple tabs to work with  simultaneous SSH connections.

Admins also love to have the ability to save credentials and use the  quick access to remote connections. Unfortunately, these are features  not available in the common PuTTY.

Although PuTTY is still the number one in popularity in this list, things are changing.

There are many far superior new tools out there, such as SolarPuTTY  which lets you save the most frequently used sessions, and also  export/import settings and share with other team members.
