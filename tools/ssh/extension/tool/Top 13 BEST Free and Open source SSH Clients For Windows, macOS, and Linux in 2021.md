SSH Protocol, thinks about protocol as rules of transferring  encoded data over the network. It is best used for accessing the remote  servers when you use this SSH key and you will get the command-line  interface of the server; it is just like you sitting in front of the  server which is situated far apart from you.

### **What is SSH?**

SSH stands for Secure Shell, is commonly implemented using the  client-server model one computer is called the SSH client and another  machine acts as the SSH server.

 SSH can be set up using a pair of keys a public key that is stored on the SSH server, and a private key  that is locally stored on the SSH client.

The SSH client which is  usually your computer will make contact with the SSH server and provides the ID of the key pair. It wants to use to prove its identity the SSH  server then creates a challenge which is encrypted by the public key and sent back to the client.
