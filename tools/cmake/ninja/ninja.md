# Ninja

Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.

## Why yet another build system?

Where other build systems are high-level languages Ninja aims to be an assembler.

Ninja build files are human-readable but not especially convenient to write by hand. (See the [*generated* build file used to build Ninja itself](https://ninja-build.org/build.ninja.html).) These constrained build files allow Ninja to evaluate incremental builds quickly.

## Should you use Ninja?

Ninja's low-level approach makes it perfect for embedding into more featureful build systems; see [a list of existing tools](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/List-of-generators-producing-ninja-build-files). Ninja is used to build Google Chrome, parts of Android, LLVM, and can be used in many other projects due to CMake's Ninja backend.

See [the manual](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html) for more: philosophical background, whether and how you can use Ninja for your project, platform support, and details about the language semantics.

## What's new

The last Ninja release is **v1.10.2**, released 28 Nov 2020. [Read the release notes](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ninja-build/oobwq_F0PpA/FeJC5LoRBgAJ).
