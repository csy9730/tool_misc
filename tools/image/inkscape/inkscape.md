## What is Inkscape？
> Inkscape is a Free and open source [vector graphics editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_vector_graphics_editors) for GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. It offers a rich set of features and is widely used for both artistic and technical illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos, typography, diagramming and flowcharting. It uses [vector graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) to allow for sharp printouts and renderings at unlimited resolution and is not bound to a fixed number of pixels like raster graphics. Inkscape uses the standardized [SVG file format](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) as its main format, which is supported by many other applications including web browsers.

> It can import and export various file formats, including SVG, AI, EPS, PDF, PS and PNG. It has a [comprehensive feature set](https://inkscape.org/about/features/), a [simple interface](https://inkscape.org/about/screenshots/), multi-lingual support and is designed to be extensible; users can customize Inkscape's functionality with [add-ons](https://inkscape.org/gallery/=extension/).

> The Inkscape project has a growing international [user community](https://inkscape.org/community/), and many [learning materials](https://inkscape.org/learn/) exist to help get you started with your creations. [Help and support](https://inkscape.org/community/) is provided by the community, and there are lots of ways for you to [get involved](https://inkscape.org/contribute/) if you want to help improve the Inkscape project.

> Inkscape is a member of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](http://sfconservancy.org/), a US 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Contributions to Inkscape are tax deductible in the United States.

By default git will download every branch and every commit. If you are on a slow machine, have limited disk space or limited internet bandwidth, you can use shallow clone and single branch [clone options](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) to limit the amount of data it will download:

```
git clone --depth=1 --single-branch --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodule https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape.git
